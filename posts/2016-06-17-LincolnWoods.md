What's a vacation without climbing?

I planned a trip to visit Ike in New York City and of course a quick trip to Lincoln Woods was in part of the itinerary. I had heard of the area from Ike over the past few years and have wanted to check it out ever since. What the woods lacked in good temps, they more than made up for in beauty. Lincoln Woods in spring time is not a bad place to spend a day.

The fine grained yet sharp granite put us all in our place as we ran the classic circuit. I'll have to return to try some of the tough ones.

Thanks for playing tour guide, Ike!
