On Saturday I drove out with Jovanna to meet up with Joey, Rachel, Cody, Itai, and Kayla for a day in the mountains. It was Joey's first outdoor bouldering experience and we made sure to show him a good time despite the hot weather! We spent the morning at one of the main boulders, the AH boulder. It's home to a few easier, but really enjoyable and high quality ("qual") problems.

After a long lunch break we headed back out to explore the area a bit more. Here are a few photos from the day!
