The annual Citizen's / CCS (Collegiate Climbing Series) Slo Op competition was held this past Saturday. Collegiate teams showed up from all over California, so Eden got a ride down with the UC Davis team. He didn’t compete, but he did shoot some photos. I opted out of setting this year so I could compete on the 90 new amazing routes that were put up.

Congratulations to Chris and Karsyn on first place and a big thanks to the amazing volunteer setting crew. They did a wonderful job and I can’t wait to get back on all the problems I didn’t have time for during the competition.
