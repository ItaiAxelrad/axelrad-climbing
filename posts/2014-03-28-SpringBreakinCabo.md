Cody, Itai and I headed up to Bishop (ok I lied, whatever) early on Sunday morning. We grabbed a quick breakfast in ~~Independence~~
~~Lone Pine~~
Big Pine (?) and headed straight for the Buttermilks where we met up with Marina, Jake and Chris. Here are a few photos from day uno y dos.

On day 2 we headed up to the classic High Plains Drifter (V7), where the gang (and 17 other dude-man-bros) all had a solid session. Here are a few photos:

Cody and Itai left early on day 3, and the rest of us decided to have a half day at the Happys before heading home.
I'd be lying to you if I said it was complaint free, but hey, we had fun - right?

Here are some pictures that make it seem like we had a chance of sending stuff that day...

As always, it was wonderful to be outdoors. Can't be more excited for this upcoming spring season. See you guys out there!

P.S. Congrats to Chris for sending The Buttermilker! yaa boooyyyy
