Itai and I decided to spend part of our birthday weekend up at Black Mountain. We drove up early on Friday and quickly got started!

Our first stop of the day was Bang On (V12) - one of the area's iconic hard lines. The climb features a large and low percentage opening move, which is then followed by a few big moves on crimps to a jug finish. It doesn't get much better than this, and Itai and I were excited to get it done. After that, we headed up the hill to try out Adamantium (V10), which we both managed to dispatch on our first go.

After that, we searched for a problem called Glow Worm (V13). This line was showed to us many years ago by our climbing friend Isaac, back when it was still a project and had not been climbed. Since then, Paul Robinson claimed the FA. We were excited to check it out after so many years. We worked out the beta and Itai was able to send it! I'll have to go back after I rest and my skin heals :)

We finished the day with an afternoon session on the Captain's Junk boulder, where we climbed Dream Tiger (V8/9) and Der Kapitan (V12). These lines have it all, with an obvious jug start, powerful roof climbing, and tall, technical top outs.

We woke up the next day and didn't possess the energy or the skin to climb much more. We called it early and left the mountain around noon. Couldn't have asked for a better birthday trip. I'm looking forward to my next trip out there!
