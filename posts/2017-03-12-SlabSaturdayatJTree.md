I made the ever familiar drive out to Joshua Tree for the second weekend in a row. There was a promising weather window before a storm rolled in that I had to take advantage of. I met Alex and Chris out at intersection rock for what ended up being a non-stop day of trad climbing.

We began our day out at Echo Tee and got our slab fix. We were confronted with plenty of terrifying run-outs, a sure way to test the confidence of even the most experienced climbers. Chris Wegener, who himself put up many of the routes at Joshua Tree in the '70s, demonstrated his friction climbing skills before suggesting that I try the area classic, Heart and Sole.

The view from the top of intersection rock at Sunset is hard to beat. A perfect cap to a full day of great Joshua Tree climbing. 

Thank you Alex and Chris for showing me around some new climbs!
