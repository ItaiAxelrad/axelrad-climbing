What started out as a daydream in some lecture hall this spring quarter finally materialized. Cody, Jason, Eden and I set out early one morning to drive nearly the entire length of Interstate 5 towards Squamish, British Columbia.

My brother and I were returning to the summer climbing Mecca after three years. The little town of Squamish (Skwxwu7mesh) is located about an hour North of Vancouver, at the end of Howe Sound. The adjacent 1,368 foot granite dome, called the Stawamus Chief, boasts some of the world's best boulder, sport and trad routes - and great summer weather, or so we hoped!

After three days of driving, and short stops in Mt. Shasta, Eugene, Portland, Seattle and Vancouver, we arrived in Squamish, our home for the next 20 days. Unfortunately, we only got one dry day of climbing before a storm came through and held us hostage at the Squamish Adventure Centre. Although we were pretty upset about the weather, it gave us time to recover from injuries. My brother and I had taken several months off due to elbow tendonitis, and Jason had just suffered a (hideous) toe injury.

Six days, 15 bottomless coffees and 1,000 pages of reading later, the sun made its much-anticipated appearance, and with it came the rest of our climbing crew. Joe, Sara, Adam and Alex (from Australia) all began to arrive.

The rest of the trip was thankfully uneventful. We enjoyed the remainder of our days in Squamish climbing boulders, sport and trad as well as eating samosas, breakfast burritos and sweet potato gnocchi.

¡Gracias a todos los involucrados en este increíble viaje!

And as always, thank you Cody for driving.
