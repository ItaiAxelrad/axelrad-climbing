Hundreds of climbers gathered at The Gear Co-Op courtyard this Wednesday afternoon to witness the unveiling of the most futuristic gym ever designed, Sender One. Adidas, Five Ten, La Sportiva, Evolve and many more companies set up booths and offered free merchandise, food, and beer.

Chris Sharma, who is one of the four partners opening Sender One, took the stage and showed the crowd clips of his accomplishments this past year. Wes, Wes and Alice, (the other three partners) joined him on stage later to explain the features of their new gym. 

The 22,000 square-foot facility includes fifty plus foot lead walls, a world cup competition bouldering arena, yoga / fitness rooms, and a play room called Funtopia. What more can you ask for?

The gym is set to open sometime in January. If you live in the area (or not) you must check it out!

We are all looking forward to finally seeing a west coast gym host a major competition.

Chris Sharma and his lady, Daila Ojeda, were kind enough to sign some posters for us.
