This last Saturday I headed up to Black with a few friends from the gym. We made our way to Hop Scotch early in the morning. It is a great looking climb but unfortunately the temps were not as ideal as we had anticipated even in the early morning. I was forced to make quick work of the sloping crimps before they became too greasy to climb. I sent Hop Scotch (V9), and made my way over to the Tour de France boulder.

Tour de France (V10), climbs up slanting bullet patina slots into a throw and finishes with a interesting top-out 18 feet off the deck. I sent Tour de France after a quick lunch break and we made our way over to climb some moderates.

Isaac Palatt put up a few moderate FAs in the area on the Africa boulder. He than showed me a project he had spotted last weekend when he was up. He said it might be very difficult but I found alternate beta that made the climb doable. I sent the project after much cleaning. It is now called Captain America (V9), and should be in the new Black Mountain guide book coming out soon.
