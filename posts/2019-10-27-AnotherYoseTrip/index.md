During our last trip out to the Valley, Cody and Joe kindly invited me to crash their upcoming Yosemite weekend - I couldn't say no! Saturday was our first day in the park and I split up from Cody and Joe while they tackled a multi-pitch route. I started off at the Bridalvail boulders and then headed over to Housekeeping before it got too warm and I called it in. I made quick work of The Seam (V11), Conan (V9), and Athletes Die Young (V5) \- which were all superb. I also got really close on Wall to Wall Carpet Sit (V11), but will have to come back for it.

There was a cold snap on Sunday and the temperature was set to drop about 25 degrees. Cody, Joe, and I decided to spend our morning in the Candyland sector before heading back home. We got to sample some stellar Yosemite classics including Once Upon a Time (V3) and The Diamond (V8). Later, Joe and I battled Shadow Warrior (V12) and nearly came out with sends - but the long weekend's fatigue set in and we couldn't link it up from the start. There's so much to come back for in Yosemite and I can't wait for my next trip!
