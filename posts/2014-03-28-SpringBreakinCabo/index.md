Cody, Itai and I headed up to Bishop (ok I lied, whatever) early on Sunday morning. We grabbed a quick breakfast in ~~Independence~~~~Lone Pine~~ Big Pine (?) and headed straight for the Buttermilks where we met up with Marina, Jake and Chris. Here are a few photos from day uno y dos.

On day 2 we headed up to the classic High Plains Drifter (V7), where the gang (and 17 other dude-man-bros) all had a solid session. Here are a few photos:

Cody and Itai left early on day 3, and the rest of us decided to have a half day at the Happys before heading home. I'd be lying to you if I said it was complaint free, but hey, we had fun - right? Here are some pictures that make it seem like we had a chance of sending stuff that day...
