        <Text>
          We are Los Angeles/Boulder based identical twin brothers Eden and
          Itai. We started climbing in 2005 and never looked back. Since then,
          we have enjoyed the many climbing destinations that the country has to
          offer. Some of our favorites include Yosemite, Bishop, Black Mountain,
          and RMNP.

          We are both graduates of UCLA master&apos;s programs, where Eden
          studied environmental health sciences and Itai studied civil &
          environmental engineering. Although we both work full-time, we still
          manage to find a little time to climb.

          We have traveled to over sixty different outdoor climbing locations
          worldwide. Exploring new crags feeds our sense of adventure, so we are
          always looking to discover new climbing areas.

        <Text>
          We have climbed well over two hundred unique double-digit boulder
          problems ranging from V10 up to V14. This base allows us to push our
          limit in terms of difficult bouldering.

        <Title order={2}>A Coach&apos;s Perspective</Title>
        <Blockquote cite='- Taylor Reed'>
          A couple of my old proteges, Eden and Itai Axelrad, still climbing for
          the pure love of climbing. Best moment in a teacherâ€™s life is the
          moment your students surpass you. With these two, I remember the day
          fondly.
