I'm planning on hitting Black Mountain this weekend, February 12-14, and just wanted to make sure the road to Black Mt was open. I mean it would seem obvious since you just posted this but, who knows, could have been an old post you made that you guys just decided to put up. I called the ranger station to ask about the road but they are closed on Thursdays...Anyway, can you guys confirm the road is open? Thanks so much!",
