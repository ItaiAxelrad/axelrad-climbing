I dropped my brother off in SLC. By evening I was in God's country.

The creek, in all it's glory is a bizarre and special place. While I'm not much for the scene, camping in the desert with a great group of friends is hard to pass up.

We were all very grateful to have a rope gun like Joe in the group. I even managed to unconvincingly toprop some 13s he walked up.

After narrowly missing a cow in the middle of the road and almost running out of gas we made it out of the valley and into civilization once again.
