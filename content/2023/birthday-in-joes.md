I made my out of Slat Lake City in a heavy blizzard and waited out the rest of the storm in Orangeville. A couple of days later I returned to the city to pickup Eden at the airport and head back to the now sunny Joe's Valley.

It was his first time at Joe's and I was excited to show him around. We amassed a decent ticklist by the end of long weekend. This included Eden's main objective, Blackout, which he fought for on the last day with taped tips. Well done!

These birthday trips always seem to produce some unforgettable climbing. Here is a short video of the trip [https://youtu.be/AY3UxEfS1c0](https://youtu.be/AY3UxEfS1c0).
