Jovanna and I headed up to Mammoth Lakes on Friday to enjoy the long (Labor Day) weekend in the Eastern Sierras. We arrived about mid day and hiked up to the beautiful Crystal Lake.

The next day we drove out to Tuolumne Meadows and had a great day enjoying the lakes, rivers and climbing. We started out by venturing up to the Ridge-top boulders to check out Space and Time (V10) \- a 3-star crimp line. Unfortunately we got slightly lost along the way, and even though the guide suggested the approach would take 25 minutes, it took close to an hour and a half to find it. By that time it was midday and the sun was beating down. Still worth it! The line climbed well and I was able to send!

After the morning session we had lunch at Tenya lake, and explored the Tuolumne River...

When it cooled down a bit we decided to make one last stop at Dana Meadows before leaving the park. Dana Meadows doesn't have many boulders, but it's home to One Love (V12), which I wanted to check out. The line fit my style perfectly and I was able to send it before sunset!

The next day we stayed "local" and ran up to Way Lake in Mammoth. It was my first time there and I was excited to check it out. Unfortunately the lower areas were teeming with mosquitos and so we decided to approach the less marshy Meadow Boulders from an alternate route (for those familiar with the area). This lead to a long and arduous search. Eventually we found a few of the boulders, but by then we had very little time and energy left. We departed Way Lake with zero notable sends and over 30 collective mosquito bites... but I'm sure I'll be back ;)
