Jovanna and I woke up early this morning in order to squeeze in a short day at Tramway. It was a beautiful, but very hot day. We started out by warming up at the Trailside Boulders, and then spent some time looking for an area called the "Undiscovered Country" - which we very appropriately could not discover. We made a quick pit stop at Paper Dragon (V10) before continuing our search.

After that we were able to find the cluster of boulders we searched for earlier. It was fun to revisit this area since I haven't been to it in a while. We spent a little bit of time climbing before surrendering to the mid-day heat and heading home. Here's a few photos...

It was nice to get back out in the mountains and explore. See you out there!
