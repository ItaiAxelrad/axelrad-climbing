I made my way to Slo Op on Friday afternoon to help forerun the problems. It was t-minus 15 hours until the annual Slo Op CCS Competition began. The routes were looking great, and the finalists were in for a surprising dyno!

On Saturday, climbing teams from Cal Poly, Davis, Stanford, Humboldt and Sierra-Nevada drove in to town to compete for the win. Amongst the Stanford crowd was Andy Lamb, fresh off of the ABS Nationals podium. It was a stiff competition with some crazy finals routes!

As always, the event was fun and exciting (with lots of beer). Check out the short [highlight video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxJ3QNgdRh8) I made if you missed out or just want to re-live the comp.

Thank you Slo Op and volunteers for putting on this awesome event each year!
