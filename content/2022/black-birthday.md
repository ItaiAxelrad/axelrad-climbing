Another year older, another birthday at Black Mountain. Eden and I left LA early so we could get some climbing in before the rest of the crew arrived and the celebrations began. It was hot but we still managed to tick off the object for the day. Allegory of the Cave - the testpiece of The Republic zone. Check out a [video of the send](https://youtu.be/_NOg4kranbM).
