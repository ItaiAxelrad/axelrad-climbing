We were off for winter break and a family trip to Mammoth was planned. My brother and I insisted on stopping in Bishop on the way up for a few hours. We arrived in Bishop, and after a quick lunch at Schat's Bakery, we decided to drive up to the ice caves at the top of the Sads.

We warmed up and jumped on Beefy Gecko. It had been years since we sent the left exit, called Beefcake, but after rediscovering the beta we were able to send the right exit.
