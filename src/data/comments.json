I'm planning on hitting Black Mountain this weekend, February 12-14, and just wanted to make sure the road to Black Mt was open. I mean it would seem obvious since you just posted this but, who knows, could have been an old post you made that you guys just decided to put up. I called the ranger station to ask about the road but they are closed on Thursdays... Anyway, can you guys confirm the road is open? Thanks so much!",

I was wondering if you happened to have a pin for the location of the boulder or any idea how to get there. From what I understand the boulder is by itself in one of the valleys in Black Mountain but I don't have any other information aside from that. Thank you so much in advance!",
