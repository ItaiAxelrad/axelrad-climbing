I seem to have forgotten how good Black Mountain is. The rock quality is usually amazing, the climbing movement is always fun, and the views are breathtaking. What more can you ask for? I have enjoyed a couple of really good days the past few weekends, including a triple double of Man is a Bastard (V10), Teahupoo (V11/12), and Howl's Moving Castle (V12) which I almost flashed.
