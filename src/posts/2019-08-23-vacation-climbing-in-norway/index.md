Jovanna and I took a 3 week vacation to celebrate finishing graduate school and the California bar exam. Our last stop of the trip was in Norway, where we explored Lofoten - an archipelago in the arctic circle. Originally, this was planned as a hiking trip, as we had no idea there was any climbing in the area. However, I eventually realized that there was in fact a lot of (incredible) climbing on the islands! Here are a few pictures of the beautiful climbs we got to sample...

On our second to last day we explored one of the main bouldering areas in Lofoten where I sent a couple of great roof climbs called Night Rider (7C&#43;) and Sunshine (8A&#43;). Both climbs shared a finishing sequence but had different starts.

After that, I tried one of Lofoten's test pieces called Monster (8A). The rock quality, movement, and setting quickly made me realize why this was such a classic! Unfortunately it began to rain before I could send it, but I knew I'd have to stop by one last time on our way out. Thankfully I was able to grab a goodbye send before heading home!

Here's a link to a video containing America and Monster: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opXYJ6H1po>

Below are a few more non-climbing photos from our trip because it would be hard not to include them!
