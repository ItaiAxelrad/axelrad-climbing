It was too nice a weekend to stay indoors, so I met up with Eden and Jovanna for a quick day trip to Santa Barbara. We ran through a circuit of the area classics like Watch The Dog and Charlotte's Web before switching over to more casual slab climbing.

The heat and the flies are a good reminder that fall is still far away. Nevertheless, The Brickyard is always a good time. Till next time!
