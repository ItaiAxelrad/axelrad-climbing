I have been emailing Wills Young about my recent Bishop first ascent, Crimps of Wrath. Wills, who is the author of the fantastic Bishop Bouldering guide, was pleased to hear about it. He decided to post about it in his blog [bishopbouldering.blogspot.com](http://bishopbouldering.blogspot.com/2012/04/possible-new-v10-on-cave-boulder.html).

A few people have commented already, several having repeated the climb. Thanks again Wills for posting, (and writing the guidebook).

P.S.

Check Wills' blog for a video of Joe Maier sending Luminance. Good job Joe!
