Last Saturday Mikey and I made the trek up to The Trailside Boulders at Black Mountain. It was a fun day exploring and climbing with other groups. We both managed to leave with a send of the ultra classic Twilight of the Idols (V10). I also sent a few other climbs in the area including Shoot the Moon (V10), Lightning (V8/9) and great slab called Diamond Zen Face (V0). Now we can both rest easy at night, knowing we won't have to make that hike again :)

Here are some pictures from the day...
