The crew rallied from Los Angeles to Bishop for what might be the last trip before fall. Eden, Jovanna and I met up with Marina, Jake and Emily in town for a coffee Saturday morning before heading up the bumpy Buttermilk Road.

The thin cloud coverage and breeze made climbing bearable despite the hot weekend forecast. After a quick warm-up, we took turns jumping on some of the area classics.

We awoke Sunday morning sore and sunburnt, but more than ready for another day of bouldering. (After a healthy dose of coffee, that is.) Sunday turned out to be hot as hell, which must have discouraged most climbers because we nearly had the Buttermilks to ourselves. A rarity nowadays!

We managed to escape the noontime sun by playing around in what little shade we could find before struggling up some sun-soaked slabs to end the trip. A great weekend with a great crew! Eden and I even opened up a few new projects that are sure to keep us motivated through the summer (Bishopless) months.

Farewell, Bishop. I'll see you next fall.
